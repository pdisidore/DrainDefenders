# DrainDefenders

This innovative system focuses on monitoring pollution in storm drains, specifically addressing a gap in existing water monitoring solutions for monitoring soil erosion due to water runoff. The primary objective is to hold construction companies and other entities accountable for polluting storm drains and, consequently, the environment with runoff soil. Unlike conventional water quality monitoring systems, this project activates only when water is present, offering precise location data by positioning sensors near potential polluters. 

The system records and transmits sensor data to users, allowing them to identify and address potential sources of pollution. Other products in the market primarily focus on monitoring drinking water, industrial processes, or natural bodies of water. This project concentrates on individual storm drains, providing a targeted approach for accountability. 

The project encompasses electrical, embedded, and software components. The electrical systems include a sensor array, power supply, and internet communication capabilities. By transmitting data to the communication system, the embedded software functions as a controller and data acquisition system for the sensors. The software system is comprised of network communications, a database, and a data analysis tool.
